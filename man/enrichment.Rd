\usage{
enrichment(
  x,
  custom.set,
  alpha = 0,
  normalize = TRUE,
  permute.n = 100,
  padj.method = "none",
  pvalue.cutoff = 0.05,
  angle = 45,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector (matrix) of scores to be enriched}

\item{custom.set}{a self-defined set that summarizes a few groups of the names (rownames) of \code{x}}

\item{alpha}{exponent weight of the score of ordered features. Default is \code{0} for calculating enrichment score via classic Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic}

\item{normalize}{logic value to determine if normalizing enrichment scores, accounting for custom set size. Default is \code{TRUE}}

\item{permute.n}{number of custom-set permutations for significance testing. Default is 100}

\item{padj.method}{correction method, one of \code{"holm"}, \code{"hochberg"}, \code{"hommel"}, \code{"bonferroni"}, \code{"BH"}, \code{"BY"}, \code{"fdr"}, \code{"none"}. Default is \code{"none"}}

\item{pvalue.cutoff}{a cutoff for both unadjusted and adjusted p-value to mark significantly enriched classes. Default is 0.05}

\item{angle}{angle of rotating x-axis labels. Default is 45}

\item{...}{other arguments}
}
\value{
Return a list including a matrix of (normalized) enrichment score, a matrix of corresponding p-value and ggplot object:
\itemize{
\item S - a matrix of calculated enrichment scores.
\item pvalue - a matrix of p-values using permuation test for the calculated enrichment scores.
\item g - a ggplot object for visualising the results of an enrichment analysis.
}

\description{
Plot enrichment map through a vector (matrix) of scores and a self-defined set that summarizes a few groups of the names (rownames) of the vector (matrix)

\examples{
# Data set 'cancers_drug_groups' is a list including a score dataframe with 147 drugs as rows 
# and 19 cancer types as columns, and a dataframe with 9 self-defined drug groups (1st column)
# of the 147 drugs (2nd column).
data(cancers_drug_groups, package = "EnrichIntersect")

x <- cancers_drug_groups$score
custom.set <- cancers_drug_groups$custom.set
